# Open Savannah: Market Research, Best Practices and Documentation Team
#### For those who like to write, to foster community, to create standards, to dig deep on data

> Please place all your research, notes, docs and more in the `/Documentation-Team` directory of the GitHub repository for `Track a Cat`


This group acts almost as the living knowledge base within the open source development workflow. You'll be tasked not only with conducting research into solutions other cities have implemented for real-time tracking, but also looking at demographic shifts, neighborhood census estimates, ridership ages and various other factors that may disincentivize residents from taking public transit. 

Show us some charts. Some market data. Give us quantitative evidence that we are or we aren't headed in the correct decision.

## Open Source Software Best Practices
You're also tasked with fostering a community of shared standards for contributions that upholds the Open Savannah Code of Conduct. One part of this is establishing a workflow for contribution that is as inclusive as possible of people with various levels of technical skills while still empowering innovation and creativity.

## Documentation and Project Maintenance
Good documentation is about more than clear instructions. It's a matter of social justice and ensuring a level playing-field for all.In the early stages of a project, you’re experimenting with new ideas and making decisions based on what you want. As your project increases in popularity, you’ll find yourself working with your users and contributors more.

Maintaining a project requires more than code. These tasks are often unexpected, but they’re just as important to a growing project. We’ve gathered a few ways to make your life easier, from documenting processes to leveraging your community.

####Documenting your processes
Writing things down is one of the most important things you can do as a maintainer.

Documentation not only clarifies your own thinking, but it helps other people understand what you need or expect, before they even ask.

Writing things down makes it easier to say no when something doesn’t fit into your scope. It also makes it easier for people to pitch in and help. You never know who might be reading or using your project.

Even if you don’t use full paragraphs, jotting down bullet points is better than not writing at all.

#### Write down your project’s vision

Start by writing down the goals of your project. Add them to your README, or create a separate file called VISION. If there are other artifacts that could help, like a project roadmap, make those public as well.

Having a clear, documented vision keeps you focused and helps you avoid “scope creep” from others’ contributions.


#### Communicate your expectations

Rules can be nerve-wracking to write down. Sometimes you might feel like you’re policing other people’s behavior or killing all the fun.

Written and enforced fairly, however, good rules empower maintainers. They prevent you from getting dragged into doing things you don’t want to do.

Most people who come across your project don’t know anything about you or your circumstances. They may assume you get paid to work on it, especially if it’s something they regularly use and depend on. Maybe at one point you put a lot of time into your project, but now you’re busy with a new job or family member.

All of this is perfectly okay! Just make sure other people know about it.

If maintaining your project is part-time or purely volunteered, be honest about how much time you have. This is not the same as how much time you think the project requires, or how much time others want you to spend.

### Here are a few rules that are worth writing down:

+ How a contribution is reviewed and accepted (Do they need tests? An issue template?)
+ The types of contributions you’ll accept (Do you only want help with a certain part of your code?)
+ When it’s appropriate to follow up (ex. “You can expect a response from a maintainer within 7 days. If you haven’t heard anything by then, feel free to ping the thread.”)
How much time you spend on the project (ex. “We only spend about 5 hours per week on this project”)

## Keep communication public

Don’t forget to document your interactions, too. Wherever you can, keep communication about your project public. If somebody tries to contact you privately to discuss a feature request or support need, politely direct them to a public communication channel, such as a mailing list or issue tracker.

If you meet with other maintainers, or make a major decision in private, document these conversations in public, even if it’s just posting your notes.

That way, anybody who joins your community will have access to the same information as someone who’s been there for years.


## For this project

Think about the scope and phases of the project and what it will require as a team to accomplish it. Try to lay out a reasonable timeline and framework for meeting certain milestones. Consult CAT officials on what is and what isn't the best strategy politically to get support for our efforts. Think about small victories. No great achievement has ever been achieved without many small victories leading up to it.
